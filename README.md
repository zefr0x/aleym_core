<h1>Aleym | عَلِيم (Core Library)</h1>

[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/zefr0x/aleym_core/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/zefr0x/aleym_core/main)

This repository contain the core library component of Aleym. A game changing, feature-rich, and highly extensible **news
aggregation system and knowledge base** designed to streamline the process of news aggregation. This system prioritizes
organization, **efficiency**, **security**, and **privacy**.

Unlike a traditional RSS aggregator or feed reader, this innovative **feed aggregator** serves as an intermediary,
seamlessly accessing feeds from various sources through specialized **informants**. It effectively communicates with
**feed readers** to present the news, taking full control of the database and networking to ensure optimal organization.
As a result, the primary role of the feed reader is simplified to just displaying the news, allowing for a more focused
and user-friendly experience.
